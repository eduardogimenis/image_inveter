Python script that inverts the colors of an image — but with a little bit more style.

Originally built while I was learning programming, this tool helped me keep the visuals in my Obsidian notes consistent with my custom dark theme.
Instead of the typical black-and-white invert, this version swaps colors to a neon green aesthetic, perfect for terminal screenshots, code snippets, or anything I wanted to blend into my note-taking setup.

I also left in the original simple white-to-black inverter, that’s where this project started before I figured out how to make the neon green look nice.
